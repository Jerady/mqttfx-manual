# Hi there!

MQTT.fx aims to be an quick and easy to use desktop tool for MQTT debugging and testing.  
I am working on MQTT.fx since more than 3 years\(mostly at night\)Â in my very, very rare sparetime.  
By now** MQTT.fx** had more than thirty released versions \(almost 1 per month\) and ciritical bugs are fixed instantly.  
Bundled Installers available for Windows, Mac and Linux at: www.mqttfx.org
