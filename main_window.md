# Main Window walktrough

At the top of the main window you find the options to edit the broker connection profiles and to connect / disconnect to a broker based on the chooses method \(ad-hoc or via profile\).

Each major use case has its own tab:

* Publish
* Subscribe
* Scripts
* Broker Status
* Log 

The Tabs are detachable so each tab content can be separated in a window. So a „publish“ windows can be placed next to „subscribe/receive“. 

If you close such a window it is moving back as a tab at the former position.
